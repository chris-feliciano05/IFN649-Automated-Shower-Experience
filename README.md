# IFN649-Automated-Shower-Experience


The project is about automating shower/bath experience using innovative sensors that will track water temperature, rate and volume. The following data are then presented to a dashboard.

Sensing: 
Water temperature sensor will be put near the shower head to check the temperature of the water. It will be set to detect certain thresholds.
Water flow sensor will be installed in the shower head to monitor usage rate and volume.

Actuating: 
Led and Buzzers will be use as actuators to indicate certain thresholds.

Preprocessing & Cloud Services: 
In this project, a raspberry pi will be used to process the receive data from the  physical layer.
Once data is gathered it will be sent through our cloud services and correlation with other information (e.g. Weather) will be combined to produce a interactive interface to users.
